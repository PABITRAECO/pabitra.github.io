### Hi! 
Hello! I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at Northeastern University. 
Before pursuing PhD, I had stints as RA at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in New Delhi and the Centre for Sustainable Employment at Azim Premji University in Bangalore, India. Also, I have been associated with Sangath in Bhopal and worked on a project understanding social, institutional, and economic barriers of vaccine access issues with the trans*, intersex, and disability communities in India. I received a master's degree in economics from Jadavpur University, India.
