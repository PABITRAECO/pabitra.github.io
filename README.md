## Hi! 
I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at **Northeastern University**. I am interested in applied microeconomics topics of health, labor, identity (caste, LGBTQI+) and enviornmental economics. 

Prior starting my PhD, I have worked as a RA at the [International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)](https://www.ifpri.org/) in New Delhi and the [Centre for Sustainable Employment](https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/cse) at Azim Premji University in Bangalore, India. I also served as a researcher with i-HEAR [Sangath](https://sangath.in/) in Bhopal, where I focused on a project that examined the social, institutional, and economic barriers to vaccine equity among trans*, intersex, and disability communities in India. I hold a master's degree in economics from [Jadavpur University, India](https://jadavpuruniversity.in/).
