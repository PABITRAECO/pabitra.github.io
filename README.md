## Hi! 
I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at **Northeastern University**. I am interested in Health, Identity (Caste, LGBTQI+) and Enviornmental Economics. 

Before pursuing PhD, I have worked as an RA at the [International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)](https://www.ifpri.org/) in New Delhi and the [Centre for Sustainable Employment](https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/cse) at Azim Premji University in Bangalore, India. Also, I have been associated with [Sangath](https://sangath.in/) in Bhopal and worked on a project understanding social, institutional, and economic barriers of vaccine access issues with the trans*, intersex, and disability communities in India. I received a master's degree in economics from Jadavpur University, India.
